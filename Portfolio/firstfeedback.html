        <h2>My First Feedback</h2>
        <h4>By Teodor Ivanov</h4>

        <section>
            <p>Let’s go back to the fourth of march right after I submitted the Who am I assignment I was very curious about the response I would get. Naturally I was nervous because that was my first official interaction with my future teachers and I was
                wondering if I did everything well. As soon as I got an email with the feedback I opened it and started reading:</p>
            <p>“Hi Teodor,</p>
            <p>nothing wrong with a healthy dose of ambition! Although I can't be sure the HZ will offer you the right place for that. It might also take an MBA to reach your life's ambitions. The first two years will be very much focused on programming
                and less on consulting or use of your communication skills so keep in mind that we will start with the basics on an operational level. Great that you are preparing upfront with your programming skills. That will be beneficial to you. I'll
                look forward to meeting you at one of our online group sessions in june/july. Based on this document I do not see a need for a personal interview however if you have any questions after our group sessions you can always schedule one.</p>
            <p>Kind regards, Daphne Heertjes.”</p>
            <p>At first I didn’t know how to react, I was surprised that there is a possibility that HZ wouldn’t be enough for achieving my goals, but after a brief moment of thinking I realised that with enough pushing and learning new things on everyday
                basis, HZ would be the best place for my creativity. In the upcoming minutes I felt very encouraged to continue preparing for the university as Daphne had said that it would a benefit for me.</p>
            <details>
                <summary>That motivation is still</summary>
                <p>going and I am not considering stopping soon. I have always wanted to make sure my family and close ones are taken care of and I think that with my creativity and the effort I’m putting in my personal development will “pay” of.</p>
