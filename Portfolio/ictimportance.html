            <p>Information and Communication Technology (ICT) is a blanket term encompassing all the technologies and services involved in computing, data management, telecommunications provision, and the internet. These technologies all deal with the transmission
                and reception of information of some kind. ICT permeates all aspects of life, providing newer, better, and quicker ways for people to interact, network, seek help, gain access to information, and learn.</p>
            <p>Communication is a key component of the ICT mix. In recent years, the merging of various kinds of technology has been increasing the number of options that people and institutions have for making contacts and keeping in touch. The ICT world
                is now trying to improve every aspect of our lives and help the world.</p>
            <p>I believe that by improving in the information communication technology environment we can help unite the separated or connect the disconnected. It is and it should be all about helping and improving.</p>
