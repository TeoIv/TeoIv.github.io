            <p>Ever since I was 15, I have always been fascinated by how games are made and what goes behind the development of a software. Mathematics has always been my favorite subject in school, and I used to picture the equations that I had to solve
                as real-life problems. For this reason, I chose to study advanced mathematics as bonus classes in school, which has substantially developed my analytical skills.</p>
            <p> I discovered my interest in IT in high school, so I started researching Front- and Back-end Web-Development and that is how my interest in the modern world of technology appeared. As a result, I have taken up a short Web-Development course,
                in order to expand my knowledge in programming.</p>
