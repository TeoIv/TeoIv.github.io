        <h2>Personal SWOT Analysis</h2>
        <h4>By Teodor Ivanov</h4>
        <h5>Sep 11, 2021</h5>
        <section>
            <p>In this article I will try to answer the following questions:</p>
            <p>What do you do best? What are your positive traits? What personality traits may be holding you back in your studies / career? How can you turn your strengths / weaknesses into opportunities? What obstacles do you face to succeed as a student?
                Could any of your weaknesses prevent you from succeeding in your studies / career?</p>
            <p>Well, I am very disciplined and determined and when someone sets the bar too high my goal is to jump over that bar. My communication level is waaaay above average and I believe that this is going to help me a lot in the new environment.</p>
            <p>A negative aspect of my personality is probably the laziness. Its not an excuse, but I think this is based on the fact that im in my comfort zone when im home, so I believe with my arrival in Middleburg I will work hard on improving in every
                aspect. My communication skills open a lot of doors and I hope they keep helping me, but now turning my weaknesses into opportunities is going to be a challenge, but there is a saying "it takes a lazy man to find the easiest way out".</p>
            <details>
                <summary>I think that</summary>
                <p>Being sucessfull in your own way is the best motivation a person can have, so I believe that nothing can stop me from achieving my goal.</p>
