        <h2>The Battle of the HTML Tags</h2>
        <h3>Article vs Section</h3>
        <h4>By Teodor Ivanov</h4>
        <h5>Sep 7, 2021</h5>
        <p>The different opinions on this topic led me on a journey to find wether the Article or the Section tag is “bigger” in a HTML structure. As I discovered the discussion is taking already years in forums and different sources around the internet.
            ( I found one written in 2011 ) But I think that the article of Bruce Lawson from Jan 7, 2020 is very helpful so I will refer to him about the meaning of these tags and the point he has. </p>
        <p>Bruce Lawson / Jan7, 2020 /</p>
        <p>“Browsers’ visual display of headings nested inside Section elements makes it look as if they are assigning a logical hierarchy to those headings. However, this is purely visual and is not communicated to assistive technologies. What use is Section,
            and how should authors mark up headings that are hugely important to AT users? A few days ago, I was having a chat with some friends, one of whom asked me the difference between Article and Section in HTML. This is one of the eternal mysteries
            of web development, up there with “why is it white-space: nowrap, not white-space: no-wrap?” and “why is CSS ‘gray’ a darker color than ‘darkgray’?”. I gave my usual answer: think of Article not just as a newspaper article, or a blog post,
            but as an article of clothing — a discrete entity that can be reused in another context. So your trousers are an article, and you can wear them with a different outfit; your shirt is an article, and can be worn with different trousers; your
            knee-length patent leather stiletto boots are an article (you wouldn’t wear just one of them, would you?)”</p>

            <summary>Anyway the article</summary>
            <p>is very long but just reading it was an experience for me, but during his build up for the meaning of the html tags I managed to learn a ton of new things. Anyway lets not distance ourselves from the main topic. In conclusion its said that
                Section can be used with aria-label to signal to a screen reader user where a particular sub-part of an article begins and ends. And Article isn’t just for blog posts - its for any self-contained thing.</p>
